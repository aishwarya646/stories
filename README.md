The Grateful Crane (鶴の恩返し)

Once upon a time in a small village in Japan, there lived a kind and poor man who made his living by gathering firewood in the forest. One winter day, while walking in the woods, he heard a faint cry. Following the sound, he found a crane caught in a hunter’s trap. The crane's wings were wounded, and it was struggling to free itself.

Feeling pity for the bird, the man gently freed the crane and took it home. He carefully tended to its wounds, feeding it and letting it rest in his humble house. After a few days, the crane's wings healed, and it flew away, leaving the man wondering if he would ever see it again.

A few weeks later, the man was surprised when a beautiful woman appeared at his door. She introduced herself as "Tsu-yo," and, seeing that he was a kind-hearted man, she asked if she could stay with him and help around the house. The man was lonely, and since she seemed sincere, he agreed to let her live with him.

Tsu-yo was an excellent weaver, and soon she began to create the most beautiful cloths that the man had ever seen. The fabric shimmered like moonlight, and when they sold the cloth at the market, they made enough money to live comfortably. As time passed, the couple grew closer, and the man became deeply fond of his wife.

One day, Tsu-yo asked the man, "I will continue weaving these beautiful cloths, but you must never watch me while I work." The man, curious, agreed to the condition and promised never to peek at her.

However, the man's curiosity eventually got the better of him. One day, when Tsu-yo was weaving in a secluded room, he quietly opened the door and peered inside.

To his shock, he saw his wife transformed into the same crane he had saved long ago, plucking her own feathers to weave into the cloth. As soon as she saw him, she stopped weaving and gave him a sad look. "You have broken your promise," she said, "and now I must leave."

With that, Tsu-yo, in her crane form, flew out of the window and disappeared into the sky.

The man waited for her return, but she never came back. He was heartbroken, realizing that in his moment of curiosity, he had lost the woman he loved.


Moral:
This story teaches a lesson about trust, the consequences of breaking promises, and the delicate balance between curiosity and respect for others. The crane symbolizes the fragility of good fortune and how it can be lost when one is not careful with what they have.
